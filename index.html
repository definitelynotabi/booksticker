                                        <p class="p1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pacific was turing golf in the setting sun. I thought about how long it had been since I'd stood on the beach at Montauk, on the opposite side of the country, looking out at a different sea.</p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could there be a god who could control all that? What did my science teacher used to say--two thirds of the earth's surface was covered in water? How could I be the son of someone so powerful? </p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stepped into the surf.</p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Percy?" Annabeth said. "What are you doing?"</p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept walking, up tp my waist, then my chest.</p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She called after me, "You know how polluted that water is? There're all kinds of toxic--"</p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's when my head went under.</p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark>I held my breath at first. It's difficult to intentionally inhale water. </mark> Finally I couldn't stand it anymore. I gasped. Sure enough, I could breathe normally.</p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked down into the shoals. I shouldn't have been able to see through the murk, but somehow I could tell where everything was. I could sense the rolling texture of the bottom. I could make out samd-dollar colonies dotting the sandbars. I could even see the currents, warm and cold streams swirling together.</p>
                                        <p class="p2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt something rub against my leg. I looked down and almost shot out of the water like a ballistic missile. Sliding along beside me was a five-foot-long mako shark.</p>

                                            <p class="p3">the fin with both hands. <mark>It took off, pulling me along. The shark carried me down into the darkness. It deposited me at the edge of the ocean proper, where the sand bank dropped off into a huge chasm.</mark> It was like standing on the rim of the Grand Canyon at midnight, not being able to see much, but knowing the void was right there.</p>
                                            <p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface shimmered maybe a hundred and fifty feet above. I knew I should've been crushed by the pressure. Then again, I shouldn't have been able to breathe. I wondered if there was a limit to how deep I could go, if I could sink straight to the bottom of the Pacific. </p>
                                            <p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I saw something glimmering in the darkness bleow, growing bigger and brighter as it rose towards me. A woman's voice, like my mother's, called: "Percy Jackson."</p>
                                            <p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she got closer, her shape became clearer. She had flowing black hair, a dress made of green silk. Light flickered around her, and her eyes were so distractingly beautiful I hardly noticed the stallion-sized sea horse she was riding.</p>
                                            <p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dismounted. The sea horse and the mako shark whisked off and started playing something that like tag. The underwater lady smiled at me. "You've come far, Percy Jackson. Well done."</p>
                                            <p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn't quite sure what to do, so I bowed. "You're the woman who spoke to me in the Mississippi river."</p>
                                             <p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark>"Yes child. I am a Neried, a spirit of the sea.</mark> It was not easy to appear so far upriver, nut the naiads, my freshwater</p>
